1. A Mechatronics system is a system that uses electrical components, software components, and mechanical components. It is also the use of complex control systems in the use of mechanics
2. The primary difference between robotics and mechatronics is specialisation, mechatronics focuses more on the general use of electronic and mechanical systems, whereas robotics focuses on the specific use-case of autonomous electronic systems; mechatronics has more of a focus on electronic and mechanical design, and robotics leans more into software design, though both heavily lean into all these different design focuses. 
3. Three main kinds of mechatronics careers are: robotics, who make production robots or convenience robots like robotic vacuums, aerospace engineers, who design flight control systems, and medical device engineers, who design things like surgical robots or prosthetics.
