2. the use of two's complement is primarily beneficial because it allows for the use of negative integers as opposed to purely positive ones, but it also has advantages over other methods to introduce negative integers into the number system. The other reason that it is useful is because the negative is integral to the number and doesn't need seperate calculation of the negative number like the sign and modulus method, and it can just add the number and the two numbers together and discard the leading digit to get the answer.
3. the answer is 0110 because if you add the two numbers together you get 0000, which is the goal of two's complement, and in an 8-bit system it would be 00001010, and the complement is 11110110
4. 170 is 10101010 in binary and AA in hexadecimal
5. in binary you, first, flip the first digit, then, for every digit after if the previous digit was flipped, then flip that digit
