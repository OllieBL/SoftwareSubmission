Boundary testing is used for testing the upper and lower boundaries of datafields being used, for example, testing an if function that checks whether or not someone is old enough to use something, testing the possible results immediately around the boundary to make sure it works correctly. Another testing method is path coverage testing which is used to make sure that in the case of there being multiple paths through a program, if you give the user choices that change the code being run, then you test all the possible paths that could be taken. Additionaly, faulty and abnormal data testing is also used to test if variables that users or other inputs put in that can't be used properly in the code, like inputting a string when an int needs to be inputted, that the code gives a proper error message instead of just crashing the program
