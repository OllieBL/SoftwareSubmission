The primary difference between unit, integration, and system testing is the scope and specific focus of what they are examining. The purpose of unit testing is to examine how well individual functions are working, usually by isolating their test to make sure that they are functioning as intended without other outside inteference in the success of the function. Unit testing is very easy to do and lends itself to being performed as the code is being written, because only one element is being tested at a time. On the contrary, integration testing has the purpose of testing how functions are interacting with each other, though still usually trying to isolate single interactions between functions. Integration testing can only be done after the constituent functions are completed, meaning it cannot be done as easily as unit testing, but it is required to make sure that the code is working properly and interacting well for the system later down the line to work. Then, there is system testing, which is less about making sure that the code doesn't output errors, and more about testing to see how well the software application fulfills the requirements and specifications of the developer, and it is the point in which developers evaluate the system as a whole to make sure it does everything it was designed to do.
