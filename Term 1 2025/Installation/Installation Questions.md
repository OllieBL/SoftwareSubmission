1. There are multiple different methods of installation that each have different use cases. One of them is direct conversion, which involves full dropping out the old system and switching to a new one, and this is normally done and is useful for when the old system becomes fully obsolete by a new system. It needs the old system to be fully removed from the application and the new system made fully useable, and the users need to be fully able to use the new system. Another method is parallel, which involves the two systems being both implemented into the system at the same time, which gives users time to familiarise themselves with the new system, but it puts extra load onto the code because two systems are running in tandem. Another one that is used is phased introduction, which is where the old system is slowly removed and more features are being placed onto the new system, which makes it easier for the user to get use to the new system because they only have to learn one new feature at a time, and it is often used in pieces of software that are still incomplete or are in active development. Another form of installation is pilot installation, which places the change onto a small collection of users to test the functionality of it, and is often the last form of testing for a product, because it allows the developer to evaluate its success in an actual functional environment.
