1. The top-down design process differs in many ways to the bottom-up design process, primarily in the way that they approach the creation of a system. The top-down approach mainly focuses on creating the overarching systems that are important, so that the overall structure is complete and the extra detail can be created later, unlike bottom-up, which focuses on creating the most important individual components which can then be integrated to create the system. In an object-oriented language specifically, top-down focuses on creating the objects that are the highest level possible in the system, whereas bottom-up focuses on creating objects that the greatest amount of the system will be made out of, for instance, when creating a game about a tile map, the first step for top-down would be to create the map class, whereas for bottom-up it would be to create the tile class. Both of these are valid approaches for creating systems in object-oriented languages, although they do have different applications
2. There are many different features of the OOP design process that contribute to the process as a whole, including the top-down and bottom-up approaches, task definition, the facade pattern and agility. One of the most important features of the OOP design process is task definition, because it allows for the entire system to planned in advance and makes it significantly easier to make decisions later along the line in production. Another key element of the design process is the use of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, because they give a fundamental way to approach the design and creation of the system, which makes the overall creation process easier because the programmer has a better idea on what they are going to program, how they will do it. Additionally, there is the facade pattern, which allows the designer to create user interfaces that are easy to understand and use, hiding or simplifying the complex systems hidden through the UI, which makes it easier for the user, and easier for programmers to make changes to the underlying systems. The final element of the OOP design process is the increased agility it offers, which is useful because it allows for the changing of systems mid-way through development or adapting to other things that change the overall goal of the system, which is very useful for designers who don't have to change the program that much in order to make it functional in the case of changes. The overall contribution of these features enables OOP to be an effective design process
